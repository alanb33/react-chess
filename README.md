# React-Chess

This is a practice attempt at implementing chess using React. <strong>It's currently a work in progress, and not yet functional!</strong> Primarily, this is a project for me to learn React by recreating Chess.

# How to Install and Run

As this is currently an <strong>incomplete codebase</strong>, the installation and run process is very simple.

1. Clone the project from this Git repo.
2. Within the project base, run <strong>npm install</strong> to install all dependencies.
3. Next, use <strong>npm run dev</strong> to launch the front-end into a browser.
4. Navigate to the <strong>Local</strong> address that Vite specifies to play. Remember that white always moves first.
